Rodent tracking systems (mice and rats)

TrackRodent is a free custom-made software published following the paper: 
"A novel system for tracking social preference dynamics reveals sex-, strain- and species-specific characteristics",
from the lab of Dr. Shlomo Wagner at Haifa university.

It is also explained in more details in the JoVE (Journal of visualized experiments) article named:
"A novel system for tracking the dynamics of social preference behavior in small rodents" 

The software can, as any standard rodents' tracking software, track a single black or white mouse extract basic parameters according to the experimental task (location, time in compartments...). In addition, the software outputs the times of interactions with "stimuli areas" that can be definds by the experimenter. This gives the option of extracting interactions times in an accurate manar. 

The output files holds matlab matrices from which the experimenter can pull the analyzed data and average accross animals (using TrackRodentPopulationSummary also available here).

Most algorithms has also a *_Fast version that extracts the results without saving the analyzed movie.

Note: The software also includes the foundations for adding more algorithems in the future.
